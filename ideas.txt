Conjecture 1: Reflected spotlight correlates with blink
  1.1) Spot present on all videos? Yes
  1.2) Spot disappears on full blink? Yes
  1.3) Spot moves right and a little down when closing in process?
	[+/-] it can also move head up and down a little bit

Strategy 1:
  1) Merge all trials from the same day into 1 video. Record frame lengths.
  2) Load into ImageJ
  3) Make two separate cuts
      - horizontal line through eye containing flash
      - circle containing flash and lower lid of the eye (empty outsides of circle)
  4) Use levels to delete as much as possible of intensity above and below the flash
  5) Apply intensity extraction algorithm. Also apply x-COM to first cut
  6) Load data into postprocess algorithm
    6.1) Select min noblink level, everything below is set to 0
    6.2) Select max rubbish level, everything above +-3 frames is set to 0.
    6.3) Define everything that is 0 as blink
    6.4) Define everything more than 1.5 times the average as wide open
    6.5) For all open but not wide open use x-COM to determine how closed the eye is.


Problems:
  [ ] Can't tell apart whiskers from paw. Both get in front and increase brightness, but one is with open eye, other with closed
  [] Double cut actually useless, as the primary flash can move all the way to the edge of the lid. It is more useful to estimate x-COM of the whole cut, sub-selecting only low intensities


Separation of trials into trial classes based on Cue file
1   :  "With Cue 1"
2   :  "With Cue 2"
3   :  "With Cue 3"
4   :  "With Cue 4"
